# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon, small)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extensions page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store, installation)

## Icon Guidelines

1. **Format**: PNG with transparency
2. **Design**: Simple, recognizable at small sizes
3. **Colors**: Consider using eBay brand colors (blue #0654ba, red #e53238, yellow #f5af02, green #86b817)
4. **Content**: A price tag, magnifying glass, or filter icon would be appropriate

## Temporary Solution

Until you create custom icons, you can use placeholder icons. The extension will still work, but may show a default or broken icon.

To create quick placeholder icons, you can use any image editor or online tool to create simple colored squares at the required sizes.

## Suggested Icon Design

A simple design could be:
- A magnifying glass (representing search/research)
- With a British pound symbol inside
- On a blue (#0654ba) background
- Rounded corners for a modern look
